## Prerequisites

An AWS account and a Userr with permissions to create componentes.

## HOWTO Use

Onthe repo we have a BASH script to setup Terraform variables. You just run './prepare.sh name' where "name" is the name that you want to assing to the project.

## TODO

- Add query instead of map on region - amis map.
- Prepare an S3 to host Terraform State File
- Moify preapre.sh script to get local IP and NSG's to allow connectins only from there
